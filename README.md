Basic story of my app:
    - As a user I'll be able to select a color I want to build my hand out of
    - As a user I'll be able to sort the given selection of cards by : type, mana cost, toughness or power
    - As a user I'll be able to add cards to a selection by clicking the cards
    - As a user I'll know which cards are selected because I'll see a green rim around them
    - As a user I'll also be able to see only my selected cards
    - As a user I'll be able to deselect cards by clicking on them again and accepting the warning prompt 
    - As a user I'll be able to add comments onto cards and I'll be able to see those comments displayed underneath
